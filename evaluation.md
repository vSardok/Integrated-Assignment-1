**Conclusion**: _I really enjoyed this activity, at the moment, I have completed all the requirements, I'm just missing assurance that what I've done for the optional part is what I was meant to do, after all, I would say that I want more activities like this one, because I learned a lot, I only struggled a bit understandig the grid and container systems. The whole activity took me around 6+ hours, completed the first 3 sections the first day in approximately 4 hours, the next day, sections 4, 5 and 6 took me around 2 hours, and today (12/02/2024), it didn't take me too much to do the P01-orders and P01-db files (I kind off misunderstood the optional part, I don't exactly know which of those files is the right one), and I'm left with some questions that I did not found an answer for, like, how do I center (vertically) any item inside a container_
